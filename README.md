# IGME.740.01 - Game Graphics Programming Individual Assignments

Download 3D models for Assignment 4 and later ones [here](https://github.com/shurunxuan/IGME740_Assignment/releases/download/MDL/models.7z). Put the folder under `IGME740_Assignment\DX11Starter` where you can see the source files. Make sure the `models` folder is not nested with itself.

## [Assignment 1 - Starter Code](https://github.com/shurunxuan/IGME740_Assignment/releases/tag/AS1)

- [x]	Download the starter code and ensure it runs
- [x]	Read through the code to begin understanding the overall architecture
- [x] Read this document and refer to it as necessary while looking through the code
- [x]	Take MyCourses survey by posting questions you may have about starter code

## [Assignment 2 - Meshes](https://github.com/shurunxuan/IGME740_Assignment/releases/tag/AS2)

### Tasks

- [x]	Create a Mesh class to hold geometry data (vertices & indices) in DirectX buffers
- [x]	Create three Mesh objects, with different geometry, in the Game class
- [x]	Alter the Draw() method in Game to draw your meshes to the screen
- [x]	Clean up any and all memory leaks, and be sure to release your DX resources properly
- [x]	Clean up any and all warnings in your code (seriously, donâ€™t submit code with warnings)

## [Assignment 3 - Making Things Move](https://github.com/shurunxuan/IGME740_Assignment/releases/tag/AS3)

### Tasks

- [x]	Create a class that represents individual game entities and their transformations
- [x]	Ensure that Meshes can be shared among multiple entities
- [x]	Create and draw at least 5 entities, with several sharing the same Mesh object
- [x]	Update your entity transformations each frame so the entities move/scale/etc.
- [x]	Ensure you have no warnings, memory leaks or DX resource leaks.

## [Assignment 4 - Cameras & Materials](https://github.com/shurunxuan/IGME740_Assignment/releases/tag/AS4.1)

### Tasks

- [x] Create a camera class that acts like a first person flying camera (with user input)
- [x] Make sure the camera class properly updates its view and projection matrices
- [x] Create a material class that represents a set of vertex and pixel shaders
- [x] Update your entity class to also keep track of its own material
- [x] Ensure you have no warnings, memory leaks or DX resource leaks

## [Assignment 5 - Models & Lights](https://github.com/shurunxuan/IGME740_Assignment/releases/tag/AS5)

### Tasks

- [x] Load meshes from external .OBJ files
- [x] Update C++ and your shaders to support a single diffuse directional light on your objects
- [x] Add at least one more light to your scene
- [x] Ensure you have no warnings, memory leaks or DX resource leaks

## [Assignment 6 - Textures](https://github.com/shurunxuan/IGME740_Assignment/releases/tag/AS6)
